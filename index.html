                Hard-working, motivated individual, looking to increase my real-life experience in the field of development and programming. 
                I have succeeded greatly throughout my major in Information Systems at Utah Valley University with more than a year of experience in C#, HTML5, CSS, PHP, and SQL. 
                I am looking for an internship or full-time job to help me learn, grow, and work to increase my skills.

            <p>The inspiration for this short poem was my younger brother. We are always making

            <h2>My personal interests:</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My number one interest is playing or wathcing basketball. I played basketball from 3 grade
                unitil sinor year of high school. I am still playing the sport today in a mens league.
                It brings me a lot of joy. My favorite basketball team is the Utah Jazz.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second interest is fishing. I love being able to be in the beautiful mountains of Utah
                and being able to relax in the middle of a lake. There is also a joy that can't be explained when
                you feel a fish on the other end of your fishing pole. A dream of mine is to go fishing in Alaska during
                the salmon run.
            </p>
            <p>
                My last interest is hiking. I would do anything to always be outside in the warm weather.
                Utah also provides a lot of hiking opportunities in which my wife and I take full advatage of during
                the summer months. I think it would be a lot of fun to travel to differnt states and see what kind of
                hiking opportunities they have.
