        <p>The inspiration for this short poem was my younger brother. We are always making
            fun of each other even though we look exactly alike.</p>

        <h2 id="Interest">My personal interests:</h2>
        <p>My number one interest is playing or wathcing basketball. I played basketball from 3 grade
            unitil sinor year of high school. I am still playing the sport today in a mens league.
            It brings me a lot of joy. My favorite basketball team is the Utah Jazz.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second interest is fishing. I love being able to be in the beautiful mountains of Utah
            and being able to relax in the middle of a lake. There is also a joy that can't be explained when
            you feel a fish on the other end of your fishing pole. A dream of mine is to go fishing in Alaska during
            the salmon run.
        </p>
        <p>
            My last interest is hiking. I would do anything to always be outside in the warm weather.
            Utah also provides a lot of hiking opportunities in which my wife and I take full advatage of during
            the summer months. I think it would be a lot of fun to travel to differnt states and see what kind of
            hiking opportunities they have.
        </p>
